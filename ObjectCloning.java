    // The throws CloneNotSupportedException clause indicates that this method might
    // throw a CloneNotSupportedException. This exception is thrown if the Human
    // class does not implement the Cloneable interface, which is required for an
    // object to be legally cloned in Java. However, since your Human class
    // implements Cloneable, this exception is unlikely to be thrown unless you
    // manually enforce it.

    // super.clone(): The super keyword refers to the parent class, which in this
    // case is Object. The clone() method of the Object class creates a shallow copy
    // of the current object. A shallow copy means that it copies the object itself
    // but does not create new copies of objects that this object references (if
    // any).

    // How It Works:
    // When you call clone() on a Human object, the JVM calls the clone() method of
    // the Object class via super.clone().
    // The Object classâ€™s clone() method creates a new instance of the Human class
    // and copies all the fields from the original object to this new instance.
    // The result is that you get a new Human object that has the same values for
    // its fields as the original object, but it's a separate object in memory.
