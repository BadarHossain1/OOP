    // Poly means "many" and morphism means way to "represent". Basically
    // Polymorphism(Greek) means many ways to represent. 
    // Java is an object oriented programming language bcz it supports Polymorphism

    //Types of Polymorphism

    //1: Compile Time/ Static Polymorphism = Achieved via method Overloading(Same name but types, arguments, return types can be different). Static binding.

    //2: Runtime / Dynamic Polymorphism = Achieved by method overriding. Dynamic Binding.
