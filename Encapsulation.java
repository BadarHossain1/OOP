public class Encapsulation {
    //Wrapping up the implementation of the data members and methods in a class. 

    //Encapsulation is a sub part of data hiding. Data hiding is protecting information and its always private. It is used to hide the complexity of the system. Encapsulation can be public or private. One example can be declaring an ArrayList. We can use getters and setters which is encapsulation, but the array that we are making should be private and that is data hiding.
